For Windows, check out the README file
in ed2k_hash/GUI/README



Linux people will just have to do the usual

./configure
make
su -c "make install"  (+ type in root password)


If you have the FLTK-1.1 library and its
development headers (you need both!) installed,
a GUI version of ed2k_hash will be built automatically
in addition to the commandlinen version on *nix.



Please file bugs and/or comments here:

You can contact me by e-mail: uberdork at users dot sourceforge dot net

Enjoy!
