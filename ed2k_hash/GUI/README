This is the GUI version of ed2k_hash. Works under Linux & Windows
(with the Shell Extension add-on for Windows).

ed2k_hash.dev is the Dev-C++ project file for Windows. You don't need
Dev-C++ to build under Windows, but you'll have to edit Makefile.win
and use it with Mingw/GCC 3.2.

======================================================================
For Linux, do the usual 

./configure
make
make install (as root)

in the top level source directory. If you have both the 
FLTK-1.1 libraries, and the FLTK-1.1 library development
headers installed, a GUI version will be built in addition 
to the command line version.

You will need the libraries listed below AND their respective
 development headers (-dev or -devel package).

If you checked out ed2k_hash from CVS, you will need to run
 ./autogen.sh in order to create the 'configure' script. You
 will need aclocal, autoconf, and automake for this.
