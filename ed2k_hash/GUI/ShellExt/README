This  is  a  context  menu  shell  extension  for  the  ed2k  GUI  for
Windows. It  has been  completely rewritten in  pure C++ (no  more MFC
stuff) and builds with GCC.

On some  versions, you  may have to  fix a  bug in Mingw's  headers in
order for this to compile.  In your include directory, find basetyps.h
and search for the line

#   define DECLARE_INTERFACE_(i,b) interface i : public b

Replace it with

#   define DECLARE_INTERFACE_(i,b) interface i : virtual public b

and it should work.
