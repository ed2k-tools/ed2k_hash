                  I have finally found the time to integrate
                  the FLTK toolkit GUI version by Jerome L. into
                  the autofoo build system. I am sorry I did not
                  get around to it earlier (admittedly I had even
                  forgotten about it). But here it is now.

                  If you want a GUI version in addition to the
                  command line version on Linux/*nix, you will
                  need to do 'apt-get install libfltk1.1-dev' on
                  debian, or install the fltk1.1 and fltk1.1-devel
                  packages of your distro (name might vary).

                  Enjoy!

This is a complete rewrite of the GUI. It now works under Linux, the
Win32 Shell Extensions are greatly improved, and the code is *much*
better :)
